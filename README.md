# billing

## Work Flow
---
The billing is a platform for shop owners to manage their stock, sales and other related shop operations with ease.

The Customer and Company are the two actors of this flow chart. A company could register through this portal thus creating a company profile. After registering a company could get login credentials, which can be used to login into the company dashboard. At the dashboard level a company could update the billing details like GST, TIN and could also provide the custom discount in prefered unit.

Company could then create bills or quotation upon requirement. Using basic customer details like Name, Email and Phone number Company could register a customer and create a bill or quotation. If customer is satisfied with the quotation then a bill is generated and stock and sales would be updated.

All the data would be backedup to cloud and from there reports would be generated.
